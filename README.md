# Clock

Clock is a small widget displaying [decimal time](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/desamber) with automatic reminders to stand, drink and [rest your hands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury) â€” inspired from [workrave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workrave).

## Beats

The clock has 6 digits, where their overall value is a ratio over the completion of the day. For example, Noon is 500, 6AM is 250 and 6PM is 750. In the 000:000 format, the shortest pulse equals to 8.64 milliseconds, the second shortest 86.4 and so on. Each break lasts 1 beat, or 1000 pulses, and is equivalent to 86.4 seconds(about 1m44s).
