# Clock

Clock is a small widget displaying [decimal time](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/desamber). It also contains automatic reminders to stand, drink and rest your hands.

## Beats

The clock has 6 digits, where their overall value is a ratio over the completion of the day. For example, Noon is 500, 6AM is 250 and 6PM is 750.

In the 000:000 format, the shortest pulse equals to 8.64 milliseconds, the second shortest 86.4 and so on. 

## Reminders

Each break lasts 1 beat, or 1000 pulses, is equivalent to 86.4 seconds or about 1m44s.
